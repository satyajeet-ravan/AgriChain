# AgriChain
AgroChain is a centralized, database-driven platform designed to connect farmers, buyers, warehouses, and transport services in a single integrated system. It helps farmers list crops, buyers place orders, warehouses manage storage and spoilage, and transport operators handle deliveries efficiently.
